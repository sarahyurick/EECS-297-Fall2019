Moreover, it can be used as a medical adherence and home monitoring tool. \n","\n","To promote preventive care: The widespread access to real-time, high fidelity data on each individual's health will reform health care by helping people live healthier lives and prevent disease. \n","\n","The more obvious challenges to adopting IoT in healthcare are storing, managing and securing data. The lack of electronic health reocrds (EHR) integration is another barrier to overcome. The reliability and security issues with data along with interoperability and a lack of training and infrastructure among providers because even when data does flow freely, many providers lack the infrastructure and know-how to access it. \n","\n","The next tier of problems lies among the populations that can benefit most from IoT; poor Internet access among vulnerable populations including the elderly, those with low education levels, lower-income populations, rural residents, and minorities. \n","\n","Source: https://hitconsultant.net/2017/11/03/internet-things-digital-future-value-based-care/#.Xc7UsVdKiMo"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_olLaUV49Kk7","colab_type":"text"},"source":["A Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) is a device that helps diabetics to continuously monitor their blood glucose levels for several days at a time, by taking readings at regular intervals. Smart CGMs like Eversense and  Freestyle Libre send data on blood glucose levels to an app on iPhone, Android or Apple Watch, allowing the wearer to easily check their information and detect trends. The FreeStyle LibreLink app also allows for remote monitoring by caregivers, which could include the parents of diabetic children or the relatives of elderly patients. \n","\n","The biggest producer of smart inhaler technology is Propeller Health. Rather than producing entire inhalers, Propeller has created a sensor that attaches to an inhaler or bluetooth spirometer. It connects up to an app and helps people with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis, understand what might be causing their symptoms, track uses of rescue medication, and also provides allergen forecasts. \n","\n","ADAMM is a wearable smart asthma monitor that purports to detect the symptoms of an asthma attack before its onset, allowing the wearer to manage it before the attack gets worse. It vibrates to notify the person wearing it of an impending asthma attack, and can also send a text message to a designated carer at the same time. Other features of the device include inhaler detection--the device can detect and track inhaler use, if the patient can't remember whether they've used one--and voice journaling to record things like changes, feelings and behaviors. \n","\n","Source: https://econsultancy.com/internet-of-things-healthcare/"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ScozqaNAATFn","colab_type":"text"},"source":["There are numerous opportunities for health insurers with IoT-connected intelligent devices.

However, within the aging American population, there’s a growing trend of individuals wanting to age in the comfort of their own homes rather than in a senior living facility. As a result, avoiding falls becomes a more difficult task, because there's no one around the seniors who can help them walk around or call 911 and notify their family members when a fall does happen.\n","\n","IoT can help us solve this problem. For example, a bed sensor called Luna Lights can avoid falling due to low resident visibility. It detects when an individual is getting out of bed and then turns on a series of wall lights and illuminates the pathway to any nighttime destination. When the person returns back to bed, the lights automatically turn off. In the case that the lights remain on for an extended period of time, indicating a potential fall, a notification is sent to the user’s support system or caregiver.\n","\n","There are still many problems remained (i.e., How are we going to define an \"extented period of time\" so that fewer false alarms will be triggered. How can we do the same fall prevention and detection during daytime?). But I think ioT has already proven its irreplacable importance in dealing with such problems. My family has always been worried about my grandfather's safety when he's alone at home, but he's not willing to go to the nursing home or to hire someone to take care of him. IoT would be a perfect solution to our problem.\n","\n","references: https://www.iotforall.com/iot-solutions-that-improve-senior-care/"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"58Os-_imEIg6","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Another application for ioT technology is neural implants.
